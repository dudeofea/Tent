So far this is just an idea that I'm building so that I can make freelance websites the way I want to make them.
I don't believe in charging for software that I've already written, or put in other terms, I don't believe in selling a "template" website, or developing on a paid website template.
I just want to get paid to write code, new code, useful code, code that ties together things that already exist into a viable product.

Each user/client is different, while they may all want wheels which we are doubtful to reinvent, that doesn't mean we should design a single wheel built to handle all terrains and temperatures but not any specific terrain or temperature. Users have different needs, and a lot of the time we can over-generalize a problem to save on money or effort.

In short, this is a CMS that forces all publicly hosted websites derived from this one, to share their source. It is licensed under the AGPL, which behaves like the GPL with the addition that network protocols (such as HTTP) count as distributing the software. So, all websites dervied from this one, must share their source when hosted.

If someone has noticed a flaw in my logic or thinks that the way I licensed this project is not advisable, please send me a message as it would be greatly appreciated!

If you think this is frivolous, facetious, or fastuous please send me a message as well as I appreciate the company
